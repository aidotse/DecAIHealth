# Decentralized AI in Healthcare (DecAIHealth)

The project _Decentralized AI in Healthcare_ (DecAIHealth) is a project as part of the strategic program [Decentralized AI, AI Sweden](https://www.ai.se/en/projects-9/decentralized-ai). The project includes the two partners _Region Halland_ (RH) and _Västra Götalandsregionen/Sahlgrenska University Hospital_ (VGR/SU), and is coordinated by _AI Sweden_.

The overarching purpose of this project is to evaluate the possibilities for jointly training and exchanging machine learning models between _RH_ and _SU_. For this purpose, methods will be used for decentralized training of joint machine learning models between both health regions, for example through _federated learning_.

The project includes three main phases (initially two phases, but now extended to also include an initial __Phase 0__):

* __Phase 0__ establishes the project's technical feasibility through a “proof-of-concept” that the network communication between both health regions is working.

* __Phase 1__ verifies that decentralized machine learning models can be jointly trained, between both health regions, based on publicly available healthcare datasets, such as the tabular dataset MIMIC-IV and the image dataset SIIM-ISIC. 

* __Phase 2__ inititates by a mutal agreement about clinical dataset and mutal beneficial machine learning models, followed by decentralized training and validation of those models based on both regions' own clinical healthcare data.


### Time Plan
The project will last until the end of 2022, and a tentative time plan for the project can be found below. However, it should be noted that this time plan might be subject to changes. (in mutual agreement between all the partners within the project). In addition, this time plan will also be updated to reflect the progress of the project (by indicating completed and remaining tasks).



## What is Federated Learning?

## Federated Learning with Flower

Flower is a user-friendly framework designed for implementing and traning machinhe learning models in federated settings [1]. <br />
The Flower framwork is _" ...a unified approach to federated learning, analytics, and evaluation."_
